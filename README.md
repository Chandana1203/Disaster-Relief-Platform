### Project Description
The platform connects disaster victims, volunteers, and organizations in real-time to address urgent needs such as food, shelter, or medical supplies. It ensures efficient resource distribution and volunteer deployment during emergencies.

### The Problem statement
Natural and man-made disasters often leave victims in critical need of resources, while volunteers and aid organizations struggle to efficiently coordinate their efforts. The lack of a centralized platform to report incidents, match victims with available resources, and communicate with volunteers leads to delays in relief, misallocation of resources, and an overwhelming response system.

### The Solution
Disaster relief platform is designed to bridge the gap between victims, volunteers, and aid organizations. It enables victims to report incidents and needs in real-time, while leveraging a matching algorithm to connect them with nearby volunteers and available resources. The platform includes:

Incident Reporting: Allows victims to report their needs, specifying type (e.g., food, shelter, medical aid) and urgency.
Volunteer Management: Matches volunteers based on proximity, availability, and skill sets.
Resource Allocation: Tracks available resources and assigns them to incidents dynamically.
