### Project Description
The platform connects disaster victims, volunteers, and organizations in real-time to address urgent needs such as food, shelter, or medical supplies. It ensures efficient resource distribution and volunteer deployment during emergencies.

### The Problem statement
Natural and man-made disasters often leave victims in critical need of resources, while volunteers and aid organizations struggle to efficiently coordinate their efforts. The lack of a centralized platform to report incidents, match victims with available resources, and communicate with volunteers leads to delays in relief, misallocation of resources, and an overwhelming response system.
